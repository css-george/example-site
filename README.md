css-george Example
==================

An example site, set up with npm, less, and css-george for runtime-editable
stylesheet variables.


Instructions
------------

Getting set up and running is pretty easy:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Now open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.


File Structure
--------------

The `src` folder contains the index.html page and a subfolder for less files.

The build process (using npm scripts in `package.json`) compiles its output to
the `www` folder.
